 I would like to offer my thanks and appreciation to the many people who made my time in Newcastle University an enjoyable experience. I will begin with my PhD supervisors, Carlo Barenghi and Nick Parker, who I thank for their endless enthusiasm, support and for never being afraid of exploring an interesting tangent. I also thank EPSRC for funding this research project, without which the finances would have been insurmountably difficult.

 I extend my thanks to everyone I met and worked with in my undergraduate studies, for showing me the way out of my shell, making lectures more fun than they have any right to be, and for years worth of friendship. In particular I will mention Sam Hunter, Josie Kendall, Seb Mellor, Holly Moffat, Keith Newman, Becca Nicholson, Maz Phillips, Chris Slattery and Jack Sykes.
