\section{\label{section:meanfield} Mean-field description}
We aim to accurately model the dynamics of a closed system containing a dilute, weakly interacting Bose gas of $N$ atoms, at extremely low temperatures. One could model the entire system by constructing a N-body quantum wavefunction, which would follow the Schr\"odinger equation, but the complexity of this method makes it extremely unwieldy to model the large number of particles used in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiments happening all around the world.

We instead model the system with a mean-field theory, in which there are essentially two main approximations. Firstly, justified by the dilute property of the gas, any binary interaction between particles is assumed to be a contact delta function,
\begin{equation*}
V(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}') = g \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').
\end{equation*}
Interactions involving a higher number of particles are ignored. Secondly, we assume all particles in the condensate are macroscopically described by a single wavefunction, $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$. As the particles all share the same phase and quantum state, $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is a classical field. This second approximation also assumes that there are no particles contributing to thermal or quantum fluctuations beyond the classical field, and so is only strictly justified when the temperature, $T$, is exactly $0\mathrm{K}$.

\section{\label{section:gpe} The Gross-Pitaevskii Equation}
The result of this methodology is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{i} \hbar \frac{\partial\Psi({\bf r},t)}{\partial t} = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V({\bf r},t) + g|\Psi({\bf r},t)|^2 - \mu \right) \Psi({\bf r},t),
\label{eq:gpe}
\end{equation}
where $V({\bf r},t) = V_{\mathrm{obj}}({\bf r},t) + V_{\mathrm{trap}}({\bf r},t)$. When trapped, the trap is harmonic and of the form $V_{\mathrm{trap}}({\bf r},t)=m\omega^2r^2/2$, otherwise $V_{\mathrm{trap}}({\bf r},t)=0$.

Taking into account the fact that the GPE is only valid at $T=0$, it turns out the equation is surprisingly successful at quantitatively modelling ultra-cold gasses, even up to a temperature of $T=\frac{T_c}{2}$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. The GPE is also successful at qualitatively modelling BEC based effects in higher temperature superfluids, such as liquid helium II.

A detailed explanation of the mean-field formulation of the model and the full derivation of the GPE is shown in Section \ref{appsection:gpeqft}.

\section{\label{section:quasi2dgpe} Quasi-Two-Dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii Equation}
	When $\omega_z >> \omega_r$ and $\hbar\omega_z >> \mu$ the condensate becomes highly oblate. Tight $z$ confinement causes the dynamics to become essentially two dimensional.
	In this case a 2DGPE can be used to model the system where $g_{2D} = g/\left( \sqrt{2\pi}l_z\right )$. [CITE PARKER THESIS] The chemical potential is also modified. See Section \ref{section:mu} for details on $\mu$.

	To effectively reduce the system to two-dimensions, the BEC is assumed to be confined by a harmonic trapping potential in the axial ($z$) direction, $V(z)=\frac{1}{2}m \omega_z^2 z^2$, where $m$ is the atomic mass.  For sufficiently strong trapping, which requires $\hbar \omega_z \gg \mu$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential of the 3D condensate, the axial wavefunction becomes ``frozen" into the time-independent harmonic oscillator ground state $\pi^{-1/4} l_z^{-1/2} \exp\left(-z^2/2l_z^2\right)$, where $l_z=\sqrt{\hbar/m \omega_z}$ is the axial harmonic oscillator length. Under these conditions, the condensate becomes effectively two-dimensional, as achieved experimentally \cite{Gorlitz}.  It is then described by an 2D GPE, corresponding to Equation (\ref{eq:gpe1}) with $g \rightarrow g/2\pi l_z^2$ and where $\Psi$, ${\bf r}$, $V$ and $n$ become two-dimensional quantities.  

\section{\label{section:gpedimless} Dimensionless Gross-Pitaevskii Equations}
	Bose-Einstein condensates can be formed with almost any size or scale. An ultra-cold BECs topology or atom interaction strength can be fairly easily changed with magnetic/optical potentials and Feshbach resonances. Superfluid helium can have vortex core sizes of $\sim$1 or $\sim$100 angstroms, depending on the isotope of helium used. The cores of neutron stars are even theorised to be superfluid. For this reason, it is desirable to rescale the length scales used in the GPE so that any of the calculations performed can be easily reformulated into any length scale desired. We make this process easier by doing all calculations with dimensionless parameters. 
	\subsection{\label{section:gpedimlesshomg} Homogeneous GPE}
		When discussing a homogeneous condensate we drop the dimensionless modifiers for each quantity and use the equation,
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimgpehomg}
		\mathrm{i}\frac{\partial\psi({\bf r},t)}{\partial t} = \left( -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + |\psi({\bf r},t)|^2 + V_{\mathrm{obj}}({\bf r},t) - 1 \right) \psi({\bf r},t).
		\end{equation}
	\subsection{\label{section:gpedimlesstrap} Trapped GPE}
		When discussing the a trapped condensate we drop the dimensionless modifiers for each quantity and use the equation,
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:dimgpetrapped}
		\mathrm{i}\frac{\partial\phi({\bf r},t)}{\partial t} = \left( -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + g|\phi({\bf r},t)|^2 + V({\bf r},t) - 1 \right) \phi({\bf r},t).
		\end{equation}
		Where $V({\bf r},t) = \frac{r^2}{2} + V_{\mathrm{obj}}({\bf r},t)$

\section{\label{section:dgpe} The Dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii Equation}
	\subsection{\label{section:gamma} Phenomenological dissipation}
	The GPE can be modified to provide a simple phenomenological model of a condensate's interaction with the thermal cloud. The phenomenological damping term, $\gamma$, is added to the right hand side of the GPE with the effect that the energy in the system no longer remains constant. The energy will instead vary over time to approach some constant value. This has the effect of damping out any excitations made to the condensate, and over time the wavefunction approaches the steady state. A microscopic justification for this model was provided by Penckwitt et al [CITE] and Gardiner at al [CITE]; by studying the growth of a condensate in the presence of a rotating thermal cloud an expression for $\gamma$ was found.
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:dissgamma}
		\gamma = \frac{4m\tilde{g}a^2kT}{\pi\hbar^2} \approx 0.01,
		\end{equation}
	where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant and $\tilde{g} = 3$ is a factor used for correction. As $\gamma$ is proportional to temperature, in this thesis various values of $\gamma$ will be used as a qualitative probe of finite-temperature dynamics with only marginally more complex numerical methods.
	In the case with a homogeneous condensate this leaves us with
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:dissgpehomg}
		(\mathrm{i} - \gamma)\frac{\partial\psi({\bf r},t)}{\partial t} = \left( -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + |\psi({\bf r},t)|^2 + V_{\mathrm{obj}}({\bf r},t) - 1 \right) \psi({\bf r},t),
		\end{equation}
	and in the case with a trapped condensate this leaves us with
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:dissgpetrapped}
		(\mathrm{i}-\gamma)\frac{\partial\phi({\bf r},t)}{\partial t} = \left( -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + g|\phi({\bf r},t)|^2 + V({\bf r},t) - 1 \right) \phi({\bf r},t).
		\end{equation}

\section{\label{section:hydrodynamic} Hydrodynamic interpretation}
	Often it can be helpful to write the GPE, via the so called Madelung transformation, as a set of hydrodynamic equations. The transformation reinterprets the wavefunction $\Psi$ as a magnitude directly related to the fluid density and a phase which is directly related to the fluid velocity. We write the wavefunction in the form
	\begin{equation}
		\Psi({\bf r},t) = R({\bf r},t)\exp (\mathrm{i}\theta({\bf r},t)),
	\end{equation}
	 and identify the fluid density as $\rho=mR^2$ and the velocity as $\mathbf{v} = \frac{\hbar}{m}\nabla\theta$.
	In vector form we obtain a continuity equation
	\begin{equation}
	  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla(\rho{\bf v}) = 0,
	  \label{eq:MTcont}
	\end{equation}
	and an equation similar to the Euler equation for an inviscid fluid,
	\begin{equation}
	\rho\left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \left( \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p - \nabla \mathbf{P} - \rho \nabla \left(\frac{V}{m}\right).
	\end{equation}
	where $P_{jk} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{4m^2}\rho\frac{\partial^2\ln{\rho}}{\partial x_j \partial x_k}$.
	A detailed derivation of this result can be found in Appendix \ref{appsection:madtrans}.

		\psi({\bf r},t) = \sum_{\bf k} a_{\bf k} \exp (\mathrm{i}{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}),
		\label{eq:cFieldIC}
		\end{equation}
		where the complex Fourier amplitudes $a_{\bf k}$ are related to the occupation numbers $n_{\bf k}$ through $\braket{a_{\bf k}^{\,}a_{\bf k'}^*} = n_{\bf k}\delta_{\bf kk'}$. The phase of the complex amplitudes $a_{\bf k}$ are distributed uniformly on $[0,2\pi]$ while $|a_{\bf k}|$ is distributed randomly with fixed mean equal to unity; it has been found that different distributions of $|a_{\bf k}|$ make no qualitative difference to the turbulent evolution[phys rev A 66 013603]. [TODO: write about choice of E and N here to get different condensate fractions]

		We also have the integral distribution function,
		\begin{equation}
		D_k = \sum_{k'<k}n_{\bf k}.
		\label{eq:intDistFunc}
		\end{equation}
		This is a coarse-grained characteristic of the particle distribution which shows how many particles have momenta less than $k$.
