 I would like to offer my thanks and appreciation to the many people who made my time in Newcastle University an extremely enjoyable experience. I will begin with my PhD supervisors, Carlo Barenghi and Nick Parker, who I thank for their endless enthusiasm, friendliness and support and for never being afraid of exploring an interesting tangent. I thank EPSRC for funding this research project, without which the finances would have been insurmountably difficult.
