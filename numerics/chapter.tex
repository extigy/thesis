	\subsection{\label{section:RK4} Fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme}
	The classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta formula (RK4) is described equivalently in many texts. We follow the description in \cite{NumericalRecipes}. Let an initial value problem be specified as
	
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} &= f(\psi,t),\hspace{0.25in}\psi(t_0) = \psi_0.
	\end{align*}

A step-size, $h>0$, is chosen as the parameter controlling how the solution is advanced over $t$. The scheme for estimating $\psi(t_n)= \psi_n$ is then written
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
		k_1 &= hf(t_n,\psi_n),\\
		k_2 &= hf(t_n+\frac{h}{2},\psi_n+\frac{k_1}{2}),\\
		k_3 &= hf(t_n+\frac{h}{2},\psi_n+\frac{k_2}{2}),\\
		k_4 &= hf(t_n+h,\psi_n+k_3),\\
		\psi_{n+1} &= \psi_n + \frac{k_1}{6}+ \frac{k_2}{3}+ \frac{k_3}{3} + \frac{k_4}{6} + \mathcal{O}(h^5),\\
		t_{n+1}  &= t_n + h.
		\label{eq:rk4}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


	An outline derivation of the Runge-Kutta scheme, which includes a proof of accuracy are shown in Appendix \ref{appsection:rk4deriv}.
	In all of our relevant calculations the value of f is set as the right hand side of the homogeneous or trapped GPE. The main loop formulating the RK4 method may be repeated indefinitely to reach any $t>t_0$. The step size for a given set of parameters should be chosen small enough that smaller choices make no quantitative changes to the resulting solution. The following section outlines the methods we have implemented to ensure numerical solutions are converged.

	\subsection{\label{section:numericalParams} Numerical stability and convergence}
	We now investigate numerical parameters which affect the stability of simulated superfluid systems. Our direct aim is to find a suitable discretisaton of space and time so that while simulations are timely, our numerical quantities are converged (so that they are not sensitive to small changes in computational parameters) and that quantities conserved by the equations of motion are indeed conserved in the computed numerical solutions.

	We begin by estimating $\Delta_x$, the required spacial grid spacing, by considering the width of the vortex core in a homogeneous system, a feature we would like well and accurately visualised in our numerical solutions. Through observation of a singly quantised vortex core (as in Figure \ref{fig_vortex}) we observe a core radius of approximately $5\xi$ when the background density is $\rho=1$. To ensure the vortex core structure is well resolved we decide to dedicate 10 grid points for a vortex core radius, suggesting a value of $\Delta_x = \xi/2$.

	In the trapped case we can use the same idea. It is shown in Section \ref{section:healing} that $\xi = \hbar/\sqrt{mg}$ for $\rho=1$. We can then easily rearrange to find an expression for $\xi$ in the harmonic oscillator units of trapped condensates. We find that our approximate grid spacing to adequately resolve the vortex core is $\Delta_x = 0.5\xi = 0.5\omega \sqrt{\hbar/(\mu \omega)} l_r$. As an example, for a trapped condensate with interaction energy $\hat{g}=2000$, chemical potential $\hat{\mu}=25.27$ and trap frequency $\omega=8.75~{\rm Hz}$ we find that a value of $\Delta_x=0.1l_r$ should be adequate. 

	Similar arguments (concerned with time rather than space), can be used to approximate a suitable time step $h$. We define a time period that we would like to be well resolved by considering by the smallest possible element moving at the fastest reasonable speed. If we define this period as $\Delta_x / 5~c$ and allocate to it 10 time steps, we find that $h = 0.5\xi/50~c = 0.01\tau$.

  In addition to this process, for each set of simulation parameters it is recommended to confirm the suitability of the chosen $\Delta_x$ and $h$ by testing the convergence and conservation in the numerical methods. The total condensate energy and particle number are good measures for this as they should both be well conserved by the GPE with a dissipation of $\gamma=0$. An example of this process (confirming the suitability of a chosen $\Delta_x$) is shown in Figure \ref{fig_energ_norm_cons}: For a large $\Delta_x=0.4l_r$ both the condensate energy and norm fluctuate wildly. For $\Delta_x=0.1l_r$ the norm is extremely well conserved to within $2.10^{-5}\%$ and the energy is conserved within $5.10^{-3}\%$. The smallest tested value of $\Delta_x=0.05l_r$ finally confirms that the energy has converged. We conclude that for the chosen system parameters that $\Delta_x=0.1l_r$ (the value suggested by the above analysis) is numerically sufficient and there is little reason to use $\Delta_x<0.1l_r$.

\section{\label{section:vortexidentifying} Identifying vortices}
Large potions of this thesis are dedicated to the study of 2D vortex dynamics. As such, accurate detection of the location and charge of densely packed quantised 2D vortices is required, and so we have developed robust numerical methods for vortex identification. The basic idea is fairly simple, with arguments similar to those used to demonstrate the quantised nature of the circulation.

As shown in Section \ref{section:quantisedcirculation}, the integrated change of phase along any closed curve $C$ is,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\theta(C) = \oint_C \! \nabla \theta  \, \mathrm{d}\mathbf{l} = 2\pi q,
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{l}$ is the line element and $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. Further, the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals[CITE] implies that $\Delta\theta(C) = 0$, providing that $C$ is continuous and does not encompass a phase singularity. This result is crucial; it allows us to directly state that a vortex lies within $C$ if and only if $|\Delta\theta(C)| > 0 $.

\subsection{\label{section:vortexloc} Basic vortex detection method}
First define a set of curves $C_k$ with each curve lying on points of our numerical grid, so that a single $C_k$ encompasses only a small region of the fluid (ideally, $C_k$ should encompass a region at most the diameter of a vortex core). $\Delta\theta(C_k)$ is then approximated for each $k$ using numerical differentiation (2nd order finite differences) and numerical line integration (trapezium or Simpson rule). If $\Delta\theta(C_k) = 0$ to within numerical accuracy then we determine that the region inside $C_k$ contains no vortices. Otherwise the sign of $\Delta\theta(C_k)$ tells us the polarity of the encompassed vortex.

In principle the result also allows us to calculate the exact charge of a vortex in terms of the quantum of circulation. However, for accurate determination of vortex location the curves $C_k$ must encompass a very small area, contain few grid points, and so accuracy is low. We use only the sign of the $\Delta\theta(C_k)$ so that the integration error makes minimal difference and results in an accurate detection of vortex polarity and location. As multiply charged ($|q|>1$) vortices are unstable (rapidly decaying into several singly charged vortices) there is no significant loss of information in practise.

\subsection{\label{section:vortexloc} Visualising vortex location with a vortex field}
The basic vortex identification method set out in Section \ref{section:vortexloc} is quick to implement and useful when there are few well separated vortices, but one can easily imagine a situation where the system fails. One such case would be two vortices both lying within a single $C_k$ curve; in the case of two similarly charged vortices only a single vortex would be detected or in the case of two oppositely charged vortices none at all!

The solution is not always as simple as reducing the size of $C_k$, vortices can be densely packed and there are often too little grid points to make this reasonable. Instead, curves with a width around the diameter of a vortex core are again used, but for every grid point (taking into account boundary conditions) the curve $C_{[i,j]}$ is defined surrounding and centred on the grid point $[i,j]$. A vortex field can then be visualised by visualizing the 2D plot of $\Delta\theta(C_{[i,j]})$. Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfield} describes the process in detail. As before, areas where $|\Delta\theta(C_{[i,j]})| > 0$ (to within numerical accuracy) signify the presence of a vortex. Figure \ref{fig:vortexfield} demonstrates a vortex field obtained from a homogeneous system with a negative vortex located at $(-\xi,0)$ and a positive vortex located at $(\xi,0)$. It can be easily seen where the two vortices are located in the wavefunction by direct observation of the 2D vortex field.

 \end{figure}

For every vortex detected by this algorithm, the corresponding area in the vortex field is composed of several adjoined points in the numerical grid. For correct vortex counting, these multiple points must be classified as a single vortex. The bwlabel algorithm described in Algorithm \ref{algo_bwlabel} is used to obtain this required classification. The algorithm takes the vortex field as input and assigns each connected component a label. An example output of bwlabel is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vortexfield}. To find the vortex location for a given label, we simply take the mean of all the $x$ and $y$ locations of points with the same label.

The algorithm described in this section leads to more accurate vortex counts when vortices are densely packed. As a bonus the accuracy of detected vortex location is improved; the final output is a combination of information from several curves $C_{[i,j]}$, and so in good conditions the result is often sub-pixel accurate (that is, the algorithm output is accurate even if the phase singularity corresponding to a vortex lies between grid points). 

\subsection{\label{section:gaussianblur} Further improving accuracy with a Gaussian blur}
When using Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfield} in `messy' wavefunctions (containing many vortices and waves), artefacts of the incorrect sign can be introduced by the numerical discretisation, differentiation and integration errors. Faint examples of these artefacts can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vortexfield} surrounding the two labelled regions. These artefacts are spatially small (on the scale of $\Delta_x$) and so can be corrected by removing all high frequency spacial waves from the vortex field using low-pass filtering. A common low-pass filter is the Gaussian blur [CITE], applied using a convolution. The Gaussian blur algorithm is described in Algorithm \ref{algo_gaussconv} and the result of applying the algorithm to he vortex field is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vortexfieldsmooth}. Note how the incorrectly signed artefacts surrounding the detected vortex regions are now removed.

 \end{figure}

 A by-product of applying a low-pass filter to the vortex field is that sharp edges in structures are blurred and spread out. To identify vortex locations a threshold function is therefore used before performing the bwlabel algorithm, i.e vortices are identified when $|\Delta\theta(C_{[i,j]})| > \Delta_{\rm th}$, where $\Delta_{\rm th}>0$ is some threshold. $\Delta_{\rm th}$ can be tweaked to make the vortex detection more or less sensitive (for either detecting vortices more easily in messy systems, or to ignore weak spurious signals in the vortex field) and in general will vary for each system.
\subsection{\label{section:ghostvortex} Avoiding `ghost vortices'}
A common problem when detecting vortices is the prevalence of invalid or uninteresting phase defects inside obstacles or when considering trapped condensates. In areas where the density is exactly zero the system phase becomes undefined. Depending on how the simulation is implemented these areas may fill with small numerical noise and cause many singularities to be detected. A similar phenomenon occurs in areas of near-zero density; well-defined singularities in the phase form but with an ill-defined vortex core in the density \cite{tsubota_kasamatsu_02}. Examples of these vortices are shown in the low density regions of Figure \ref{fig:ghostvortex}. As these singularities carry negligible angular momentum and energy they are of no interest and are termed `ghost vortices'.

 \end{figure}

A simple way to remove ghost vortices is to use a mask to hide vortices found in low-density regions in trapped systems and inside obstacles. While on the one hand it is easy to define a mask using the TF radius or considering where $V_{\rm trap} + V_{\rm obj}>1$, masks are quite arbitrary in nature and an overzealous mask may hide details. Additionally, any condensate with certain excitations such a breathing mode or centre of mass oscillation will periodically extend beyond a hard coded mask.

An alternative method to avoid identifying ghost vortices presents itself when implementing Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfield}. The vortex field can be multiplied by the wavefunction density (as a fraction of its maximal value) at every point {\it before} performing the Gaussian convolution step. The result is that in low-density areas the vortex field becomes completely zero and singularities in this region are no longer identified as vortices. At the centre of vortex cores the vortex field also goes to zero. However, enough vortex information remains in the vortex field in the vicinity of the vortex cores that vortices in high-density regions are still identified accurately after the Gaussian convolution. As before, the threshold value $\Delta_{\rm th}$ controls the sensitivity of this algorithm, in particular for detecting vortices in the low density regions of the condensate. Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfielddens} describes this method in further detail and Figure \ref{fig:filtervortexlattice} shows the vortex field with and without the added step of multiplying by the density, demonstrating that the ghost vortices detected when using Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfield} are indeed removed when using Algorithm \ref{algo_calcvortexfielddens}.

\section{\label{section:quasi-condensate} Quasi-Condensate Visualisation}
When in the context of the classical-field method of simulating a finite temperature Bose gas, the raw numerical wavefunction is too noisy to allow direct visualization of vortical structures, this can be overcome by defining a quasi-condensate wavefunction $\hat{\psi}$, as established in \cite{PhysRevA.66.013603}.   This wavefunction is constructed by filtering out high-frequency spatial modes from the classical field wavefunction, by 
transforming the complex amplitudes via
$\hat{a}_{{\bf k}} = a_{{\bf k}}\times\max\{1-k^{2}/k_c^2,0\}$. $\hat{\psi}$ represents the long-wavelength component of the classical field.

The choice of $k_c$ is facilitated by the the bimodal distribution of occupation numbers in the wavefunction, a distribution which develops naturally through propagation of the GPE. The high-$k$ part of the distribution is associated with the thermal excitations and low mode occupations. The low-$k$ part of the field is the quasi-condensate, characterised by macroscopic mode populations and superfluid ordering. $k_c$ is chosen as the boundary in $k$-space between the quasi-condensate and the thermal gas, as performed in \cite{PhysRevA.66.013603}. Figure \ref{fig:quasicondensatefilter} demonstrates the filtering technique in action.

\section{\label{section:linelength} Evaluation of vortex line-length in 3D}
For a given 3D wavefunction, $\Psi$, featuring a vortex distribution, the vortex volume $V_t$ (the total volume associated with the vortex cores) is evaluated by numerical integration of the inside of the vortex isosurface tubes obtained from the filtered density $|\hat \Psi|^2$, with an integration region of the whole numerical box.  Note that the isosurface level should be low enough to pick out vortex cores only (and not, e.g. fluctuations and waves), while large enough to contain sufficient grid points to allow a reasonable numerical evaluation of volume. In this work we use the isosurface level $0.04\langle |\hat{\Psi}|^2 \rangle$ (chosen so as to produce filtered vortex cores that are similar in radius to the true vortex core).  The volume calculation can be written $V_t = \int \Theta(0.04\langle |\hat{\Psi}|^2 \rangle - |\hat{\Psi}({\bf r})|^2)~{\rm d}V$, where $\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function. In practice the calculation of the vortex core volume can be efficiently performed by assigning a value of unity/zero to grid points located within/outside the isosurface tubes and directly integrating the result using the trapezium or Simpson's rule.

The total line length is then deduced by dividing $V_t$ by the cross-sectional area of a vortex core, $A_t$ (in effect, the average cross-sectional area of the isosurface tubes). The measured values of $V_t$ and $A_t$ will depend on the chosen isosurface level but, providing the vortex tubes are well-separated, their ratio (and hence the evaluated line length) will remain constant.  For closely-positioned vortex tubes, the isosurface level can affect whether the tubes appear as two separate tubes, or start to merge, and so will lead to deviations in this ratio.  We have tested the effect of an alternative isosurface value.  For twice the original isosurface value, the difference in the calculated line length is negligible for systems with low vortex density.  For cases with the highest density of vortices, the difference remains less than $10\%$.
